# Arduino
Arduino projects I've worked on independently

Please, don't take this too seriously.

I have a long background in computer programming from taking Java all the way back in my junior year of high school.

My love of cars prevailed when it was time to pick a college major and I ended up in Mechanical Engineering

Over quarantine I exposed myself to some arduino projects in hopes to pivot off into a robotics position.

I completed approximately 2 dozen projects and started having unique ideas of my own.

Most of these were poorly documented but some SnapChat relics remain alongside their code.

The Arduino language is C++

I'm definitely more fascinated with programing components that provide physical output in real life.

Some of my other favorite projects involved using ultrasonic distance sensors as hands free "buttons".
I would use these sensors to turn lights on and off by controlling a relay I spliced into an extension cable.

Enjoy!
